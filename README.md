- ðŸ˜„ Summary :Ever since I was a little kid, learning something creative has been my passion. I still remember myself when I was a kid and I used to get lots of toys to play but on the next day, my curiosity was to Open the toys and see the mechanism of how it works. That's why curiosity about studying engineering developed from school life itself. I got lots of knowledge from my school life. Lots of mini-projects, exhibition, and visits in industry help us to gain useful knowledge during school life. The school not only developed my knowledge but also developed a professional skill in me . After completing school life I selected IT as my primary subject as I was very interested in coding. After staying two years in jr.college I was enriched with lots of coding and many mini-projects. S.M Shetty jr. college provided lots of seminars on the latest technology which again gifted me with knowledge of Automation and many other things.
After completing jr college I was with two interest One was coding and the other was a curiosity to study the car design. So I decided to Take B.tech in mechanical engineering . During this duration, I studied c-programming, python, Machine learning, Designing, C.F.D, Analysis, Automobile, Artificial intelligence, Aerospace, Bussiness development. Till now I am a final year and still developing more skills to add to the profession.
I do my work on the basis of my target. If I set my target that means I can't do anything without completing that task. For me, engineering is a field where you can bring your dream into reality. Everything is possible to innovate with the knowledge of the filed and practical approach.During my B.Tech college time, I just got shortlisted for entrepreneurship in Istanbul. Also, I have been selected In the smart India Hackathon where my curiosity for design has increased to a high level.
Anyone interested in technical discussion, I am always in touch.
